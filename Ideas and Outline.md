### Main interest: food insecurity, health, food assistance
- Breakdown by: children / families / seniors
- Overlay: socioeconomic, demographic data

* Look for correlations

### Issues
- Missing data (by county)
    - How to aggregate data (mean, median, etc.)
- Time of collection for different variables don't always sync up

* Sometimes there is time series data

### Other data to find:
- Population: total, children, seniors
- Can overlay data from Google Maps API: need to explore more, try to find "food deserts"

### We think not so related:
- Farmland / farmers' markets
- Prices/taxes
- Physical activity

### Cool topics:
- Compare percent change in population to food insecurity
- Compare percent change in population to restaurants / food resources
- Compare percent change in median income to food insecurity
- Compare percent change in median income to restaurants / food resources

### Other cool stuff:
- Add government data / press releases and news articles to tell our story for the final presentation
